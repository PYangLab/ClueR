Description: CLUster Evaluation (CLUE) is a computational method for identifying 
              optimal number of clusters in a given time-course dataset clustered by 
              cmeans or kmeans algorithms and subsequently identify key kinases or 
              pathways from each cluster. Its implementation in R is called ClueR. 
              See README on <https://github.com/PengyiYang/ClueR> for more details.
