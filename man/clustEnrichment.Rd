\usage{
clustEnrichment(
  clustObj,
  annotation,
  effectiveSize,
  pvalueCutoff = 0.05,
  universe = NULL
)
}
\arguments{
\item{clustObj}{the clustering object generated by cmeans or kmeans.}

\item{annotation}{a list with names correspond to kinases and elements correspond to substrates belonging to each kinase.}

\item{effectiveSize}{the size of kinase-substrate groups to be considered for calculating enrichment. Groups that are too small
or too large will be removed from calculating overall enrichment of the clustering.}

\item{pvalueCutoff}{a pvalue cutoff for determining which kinase-substrate groups to be included in calculating overall enrichment of the clustering.}

\item{universe}{the universe of genes/proteins/phosphosites etc. that the enrichment is calculated against.}
}
\value{
a list that contains both the p-value indicating the overall enrichment and a sublist that details the enrichment of each individual cluster.
}
\description{
Takes a clustering object generted by cmeans or kmeans algorithm and determine the enrichment of each cluster
and then the overall enrichment of this clustering object based on an annotation file.

# simulate a time-series data with six distinctive profile groups and each group with
# a size of 500 phosphorylation sites.

# create an artificial annotation database. Generate 100 kinase-substrate groups each
# comprising 50 substrates assigned to a kinase. 
# among them, create 5 groups each contains phosphorylation sites defined to have the
# same temporal profile.
